            <p>
                WALTHAM, MA&ndash;Engineers, researchers and designers at famed robotics company Boston Dynamics cheered as the firm&apos;s CEO, 
                Greg Marino, unveiled their newest prototype: Rocco, a robot that poops. 
                Rocco&mdash;a strapping, titanium robot standing at 6 feet 4 inches&mdash;was on stage and waved to the crowd as Marino made the announcement. 
                The robot is the first of its kind to sustainably defecate, a feat which scientists find promising for future innovation. 
                In explaining the motivations for developing Rocco, 
                Marino hinted at rising feelings of unease surrounding the company&apos;s sometimes intimidating products, 
                &ldquo;As we get closer and closer to deploying our humanoid robots in public life, 
                we are striving to give them features relatable to all. Sure, our existing legacy robots can outrun, 
                outjump and overpower humans, but they still can&apos;t poop.&rdquo; 
                When asked how the excrement replenishes given that Rocco neither digests food nor eats, 
                Marino abruptly replied that such knowledge is classified. The project still has a long way to go, 
                as stressed by head research scientist, Dr. Taisia Jackson PhD: &ldquo;In the next phase of development, 
                we will utilize supervised learning and reinforcement techniques such that 
                Rocco will release its fecal matter into precise targets with up to 99 percent accuracy. 
                Some may call this process &lsquo;toilet training.&rsquo;&rdquo; 
                Currently, Rocco stops and empties its mechanical bowels every three hours regardless of activity or terrain, 
                which has left some employees no choice but to wear nose plugs, as well as plastic bags over their shoes. 
                At press time, Rocco began to squat while staring menacingly at the cameras.
