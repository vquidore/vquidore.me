            Breaking: Mayor Eric Adams Vanquished By Ragtag Band Of Rodents In Shocking End To NYC War On Rats
        </h1>

                NEW YORK, NY&ndash;In what animals across the city are celebrating as a “triumph over evil,” 
                a ragtag band of rodents has vanquished New York City Mayor Eric Adams (D), putting a decisive end to Mayor Adams&apos; 
                War on Rats that began last April. The rodents in question are a coalition of rats, house mice, 
                deer mice, squirrels, beavers, North American porcupines, radicalized hamsters and one wisened marmot 
                who each pledged solidarity to their fellow species after the mayor&apos;s declaration of war last year. 
                The misfit team announced their victory on social media. One member, identified as Fiddles The Friendly Rat, 
                posted a selfie with the group high-fiving around a hogtied and gagged Mayor Adams on his office floor. 
                The caption reads, “Hip-hip hooray! We defeated the naughty human and saved the day! #warisover.” 
                Kathleen Corradi, NYC&apos;s &lsquo;Rat Czar,&rsquo; responded to the post in an official statement: 
                “It is with a heavy heart that I announce NYC&apos;s official surrender in the War on Rats due to the vanquishment of Mayor Adams. 
                Under international human-rodent law, when a human is vanquished by sentient rodents, 
                all conflict must immediately cease with an official resolution agreed upon by both parties. 
                We have no choice in this matter.” What happens next for Mayor Adams is still unknown, 
                but in his reply to a human journalist who asked about Adams&apos; fate, Fiddles simply wrote, “Hehe.” 
                According to the NYC Mayor&apos;s Office, peace negotiations are set to begin in early August. 
                More on this story as it develops.
