                NEW YORK, NY&ndash;In what animals across the city are celebrating as a &ldquo;triumph over evil,&rdquo; 
                a ragtag band of rodents has vanquished New York City Mayor Eric Adams (D), putting a decisive end to Mayor Adams&apos; 
                War on Rats that began last April. The rodents in question are a coalition of rats, house mice, 
                deer mice, squirrels, beavers, North American porcupines, radicalized hamsters and one wisened marmot 
                who each pledged solidarity to their fellow species after the mayor&apos;s declaration of war last year. 
                The misfit team announced their victory on social media. One member, identified as Fiddles The Friendly Rat, 
                posted a selfie with the group high-fiving around a hogtied and gagged Mayor Adams on his office floor. 
                The caption reads, &ldquo;Hip-hip hooray! We defeated the naughty human and saved the day! #warisover.&rdquo; 
                Kathleen Corradi, NYC&apos;s &lsquo;Rat Czar,&rsquo; responded to the post in an official statement: 
                &ldquo;It is with a heavy heart that I announce NYC&apos;s official surrender in the War on Rats due to the vanquishment of Mayor Adams. 
                Under international human-rodent law, when a human is vanquished by sentient rodents, 
                all conflict must immediately cease with an official resolution agreed upon by both parties. 
                We have no choice in this matter.&rdquo; What happens next for Mayor Adams is still unknown, 
                but in his reply to a human journalist who asked about Adams&apos; fate, Fiddles simply wrote, &ldquo;Hehe.&rdquo; 
                According to the NYC Mayor&apos;s Office, peace negotiations are set to begin in early August. 
                More on this story as it develops.
