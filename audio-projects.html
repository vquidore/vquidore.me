            &ldquo;The Dispatcher&apos;s DM&rdquo; &mdash; 
            I produced this audio documentary for an assignment in my creative archival nonfiction class, 
            <a href="https://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/departments-programs-undergraduate/english-and-creative-writing/engl-and-crwt-english-and-creative-writing-courses/section-iii-special-topics-courses/crwt-40-03/">Raising the Dead</a>, 
            in which the objective was to recreate the moments surrounding a document, such as a photograph, a letter, 
            or a social media post. I attempted to recreate the moments surrounding the DM below. 
            The DM was sent to Chris Garrett, the old station manager of WFRD, 
            who worked with Dartmouth College Radio until the FM station was sold by the College&apos;s administration in 2021. 
            We still have the screenshot that he printed out hanging in the station. 
            This project uses audio from the Within The Trenches Media <a href="https://www.withinthetrenches.net/audio-library">9-1-1 Audio Library</a> 
            compiled by Gary Allen, who wrote and published Dispatch Magazine Online.

        &ldquo;Hey I just wanted to tell you that you and 99 Rock is what gets me home in the mornings after sometimes very long 12 hour shifts. 
        I don&apos;t advertise what I do for a living because growing up in small towns 
        and working as a dispatcher for a police department could be tricky sometimes, 
        and it keeps people from constantly asking about stuff going on in the upper valley. 
        I love what I do and being a dispatcher for 27 towns fire adn EMS, plus 8 towns for police makes for a shift of crazy and unexpected. 
        BUT, once in awhile you have that one shift, that one call that breaks your heart, and makes your soul hurt. 
        Monday morning was one of those shiftsadn thankfully my last one for a week because I took a staycation. 
        I knew I just needed to make it home to just shut my mind down for a few hours and I would be fine. 
        I got into my car and thankfully always have your station ready to go, 
        and it was perfect timing because you were doing mad trivia 
        and your voice and the laughter in it gave me the peace I needed in that moment on the brink of just sobbing. 
        I just want you to know that you make a difference in so many ways, and probably don&apos;t even realize that you do. 
        Like I said I don&apos;t make my work or stories public but I wanted you to know that you help and to say thank you. 
        Full disclosure, I am a music slut so I surf all upper valley radio stations, but you are my only go to at 7AM.&rdquo;">

            While at the station, I served as GM (2022-2024) and Technical Director (2020-2022), 
            and I worked with <a href="https://webdcr.com/news/">WDCR News</a> as a broadcast journalist (2020-2022). 
            Throughout my four years at WDCR, I also produced and hosted weekly, hour-long radio shows, including:
