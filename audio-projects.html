            &ldquo;The Dispatcher&apos;s DM&rdquo; &mdash; 
            I produced this audio documentary for an assignment in my creative archival nonfiction class, 
            <a href="https://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/departments-programs-undergraduate/english-and-creative-writing/engl-and-crwt-english-and-creative-writing-courses/section-iii-special-topics-courses/crwt-40-03/">Raising the Dead</a>, 
            in which the objective was to recreate the moments surrounding a document, such as a photograph, a letter, 
            or a social media post. I attempted to recreate the moments surrounding the DM below. 
            The DM was sent to Chris Garrett, the old station manager of WFRD, 
            who worked with Dartmouth College Radio until the FM station was sold by the College&apos;s administration in 2021. 
            We still have the screenshot that he printed out hanging in the station. 
            This project uses audio from the Within The Trenches Media <a href="https://www.withinthetrenches.net/audio-library">9-1-1 Audio Library</a> 
            compiled by Gary Allen, who wrote and published Dispatch Magazine Online.

            While at the station, I served as GM (2022-2024) and Technical Director (2020-2022), 
            and I worked with <a href="https://webdcr.com/news/">WDCR News</a> as a broadcast journalist (2020-2022). 
            Throughout my four years at WDCR, I also produced and hosted weekly, hour-long radio shows, including:
