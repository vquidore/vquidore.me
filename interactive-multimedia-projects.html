            In 2023, I worked as the staff assistant intern for the 
            Wilson Center Science and Technology Innovation Program's <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/program/serious-games-initiative">Serious Games Initiative</a>, 
            which strives to communicate critical science and technology issues through game design. 
            I conducted academic research and translated that work into engaging narrative and game mechanics design. 
            I was fortunate to be part of the teams that made the following games:

                        The image includes a game description, which reads: 
                        follow the trail of the life cycle of single-use plastics, 
                        and uncover policies that can unplug pollution leaking into our oceans.">

                        Sputnik One, was successfully launched into orbit by the Soviet Union, 
                        the impact of satellites is more integrated into our lives than ever before. 
                        Here we will take you on five layers of orbit we use for satellites and other space bodies to answer the core questions: 
                        what do we put into space and why do we put it where it is?">
