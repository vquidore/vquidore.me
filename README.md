## A portfolio and playground

I first developed this website to host my digital installation, [ENCODED WDCR](https://vquidore.me/projects/encodedwdcr.html), for my Fall 2022 class *Data and Bodies*. The project explored the meaning of space and emotion in the preservation of a college broadcast organization's memory and leaves us to reflect on what gets lost and what remains in the transposition of a community space into a digital archive. This work developed in dialogue with Ann Cvetkovich's *An Archive of Feeling*. 

ENCODED WDCR was my first project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the website has since evolved into a portfolio for my work in data science and software development, audio and multimedia production, and writing. This has become a playground for me to further explore the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other elements of front-end and back-end engineering of personal interest.
