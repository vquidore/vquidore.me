            Hi hello! I&apos;m V. Welcome to my website!
        </h2>
        <h3>
            I am a computational linguistics and data science student investigating the intersections of technology, new media, ethics, and language. 
            I love a good story, a fun game, and a strongly-used verb. 
            In my free time, you can find me in my college radio station writing screenplays, fighting poltergeists, and talking to the void.
        </h3>

            I really love my college radio station. Like, really really love it.
