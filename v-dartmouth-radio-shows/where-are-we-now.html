            alt="Radio show album cover of notebook paper containing musical notes coming out of an image of the Earth from space. 
            The text around the globe and musical notes reads, &ldquo;Where Are We, Now?&rdquo; 
            A tear in the bottom right corner of the paper reveals a masked V standing on the Dartmouth Green on a sunny day. The white Baker Tower is behind them in the background. 
            They shrug in question with their head turned up towards Earth.">
