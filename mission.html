            <p>
                V Quidore strives to write a powerful mission statement reflective of their greatest mission in life. 
                They would like to thank you, their current viewer, for supporting their mission.
            </p>
            <p style="padding-top: 48px;">
                ...But in all seriousness, I believe in the power and potential of public media, 
                and I am passionate about repairing America&apos;s media and information ecosystems. 
                And while some day, I hope to ultimately contribute to that change on an infrasructural level, 
                for now, I am trying to build community in all that I do 
                from as many different perspectives as possible,
                whether it be tinkering in local and college radio stations, 
                or designing games that spark curiosity, 
                or coding art installations that offer new perspectives on togetherness and memory. 
            </p>
            <p style="padding-top: 72px;">
                This mission, like me, will inevitably change, 
                but for now, it&apos;s a glimpse of where I&apos;m currently at.
